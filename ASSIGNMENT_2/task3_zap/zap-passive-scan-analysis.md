## 2. High Priority Findings

### No High or Critical Risk Issues Found ✅

The passive scan did not identify any High or Critical severity vulnerabilities. However, there are **4 Medium severity issues** that require attention.

---

## 3. Medium Risk Findings (Require Action)

### Finding #1: Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Alert Name:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set  
**Risk Level:** Medium (High Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-693 - Protection Mechanism Failure  
**WASC:** WASC-15 - Application Misconfiguration  
**OWASP Reference:** [https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)

#### Affected URLs
- `http://localhost:4100` (Main application page)

#### Description
Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page.

The main application page does not set a Content-Security-Policy header, leaving it vulnerable to various injection attacks.

#### Security Impact
- **XSS Risk:** Without CSP, the application is more vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks
- **Data Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts from unauthorized sources
- **Clickjacking:** Without proper CSP directives, iframe-based attacks are easier
- **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious scripts could send sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers

#### Evidence
- **URL:** `http://localhost:4100`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameter:** N/A
- **Evidence:** Header not present in response

#### Remediation
Ensure that your web server, application server, or Express server is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header. 

**Recommended CSP Header:**
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; 
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; 
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; 
  img-src 'self' data: https:; 
  connect-src 'self' https://conduit.productionready.io;
```

**Note:** `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` should be removed in production for better security, but may be required for React development builds.

### Finding #2: CSP - Failure to Define Directive with No Fallback

**Alert Name:** CSP: Failure to Define Directive with No Fallback  
**Risk Level:** Medium (High Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-693 - Protection Mechanism Failure  
**WASC:** WASC-15 - Application Misconfiguration  
**OWASP Reference:** [https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)

#### Affected URLs
1. `http://localhost:4100/robots.txt`
2. `http://localhost:4100/sitemap.xml`

#### Description
The Content Security Policy fails to define one of the directives that has no fallback. Missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything. The directives `frame-ancestors` and `form-action` do not fallback to `default-src`, so they must be explicitly defined.

#### Security Impact
- **Clickjacking:** Without `frame-ancestors`, the page can be embedded in iframes
- **Form Manipulation:** Without `form-action`, forms can submit to any origin
- **Phishing Risk:** Attackers could embed these pages in malicious sites

#### Evidence

**Instance 1: robots.txt**
- **URL:** `http://localhost:4100/robots.txt`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameter:** Content-Security-Policy
- **Evidence:** `default-src 'none'`
- **Other Info:** The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action is/are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src.

**Instance 2: sitemap.xml**
- **URL:** `http://localhost:4100/sitemap.xml`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameter:** Content-Security-Policy
- **Evidence:** `default-src 'none'`
- **Other Info:** The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action is/are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src.

#### Remediation
Update the CSP header for these files to include the missing directives:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; 
  frame-ancestors 'none'; 
  form-action 'none';
```

---

### Finding #3: Missing Anti-clickjacking Header

**Alert Name:** Missing Anti-clickjacking Header  
**Risk Level:** Medium (Medium Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-1021 - Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames  
**WASC:** WASC-15 - Application Misconfiguration  
**OWASP Reference:** [https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)

#### Affected URLs
- `http://localhost:4100` (Main application page)

#### Description
The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options header. Clickjacking is an attack that tricks users into clicking on something different from what they perceive, potentially revealing confidential information or allowing attackers to take control of the user's account.

#### Security Impact
- **UI Redressing:** Attackers can overlay transparent iframes over legitimate UI elements
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Users may unknowingly perform actions (delete account, transfer money, etc.)
- **Credential Theft:** Login forms could be overlaid to capture credentials
- **Session Hijacking:** User sessions could be compromised through clickjacking attacks

#### Evidence
- **URL:** `http://localhost:4100`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameter:** `x-frame-options`
- **Evidence:** Header not present

#### Exploit Scenario
1. Attacker creates a malicious website
2. Embeds the RealWorld Conduit app in an invisible iframe
3. Overlays fake UI elements that align with real buttons in the iframe
4. User clicks what appears to be a harmless button
5. Actually clicks "Delete Article" or "Follow User" in the hidden iframe

#### Remediation
Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.

**Option 1: X-Frame-Options (Simpler, Older)**
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```
Or if you need to embed the page on your own site:
```
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

**Option 2: CSP frame-ancestors (Modern, Preferred)**
```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';
```

---

### Finding #4: Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing

**Alert Name:** Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing  
**Risk Level:** Medium (High Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-345 - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity  
**WASC:** WASC-15 - Application Misconfiguration  
**OWASP Reference:** [https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90003/](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90003/)

#### Affected URLs
- `http://localhost:4100` (Main application page)

#### Description
The integrity attribute is missing on a script or link tag served by an external server. The integrity tag prevents an attacker who has gained access to this server from injecting malicious content. Without Subresource Integrity (SRI), if a CDN or external resource is compromised, malicious code could be injected into your application.

#### Security Impact
- **Supply Chain Attack:** Compromised CDN could serve malicious code
- **Code Injection:** External resources could be modified to include malware
- **Data Theft:** Modified external scripts could steal user data
- **Session Hijacking:** Malicious scripts could capture authentication tokens
- **Cryptojacking:** Compromised resources could mine cryptocurrency

#### Evidence
- **URL:** `http://localhost:4100`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameter:** N/A
- **Evidence:** 
  ```html
  <link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Titillium+Web:700|Source+Serif+Pro:400,700|Merriweather+Sans:400,700|Source+Sans+Pro:400,300,600,700,300italic,400italic,600italic,700italic" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  ```

#### Real-World Example
In 2018, the British Airways website was compromised when attackers modified a JavaScript library loaded from a third-party CDN, resulting in the theft of 380,000 payment cards. SRI would have prevented this attack.

#### Remediation
Provide a valid integrity attribute to external resource tags.

**For Google Fonts (Current Issue):**
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Titillium+Web:700|..." 
      rel="stylesheet" 
      type="text/css"
      crossorigin="anonymous">
```

**Note:** Google Fonts serves dynamic CSS based on browser capabilities, making traditional SRI hashes impractical. Instead:
1. Use HTTPS (✅ should be enforced)
2. Add `crossorigin="anonymous"` for CORS
3. Use CSP to whitelist `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`
4. **Better Solution:** Self-host fonts for full control

**For static external resources (general solution):**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js"
        integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/ux..."
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## 4. Common Issues Found

### A. Missing Security Headers (Most Critical)

The application is missing several critical security headers that are considered security best practices:

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Content-Security-Policy** ❌ - Not set on main page
2. **X-Frame-Options** ❌ - Missing (allows clickjacking)
3. **X-Content-Type-Options** ❌ - Missing (allows MIME-sniffing)
4. **Permissions-Policy** ❌ - Not set
5. **Cross-Origin Headers** ❌ - Missing Spectre mitigations

#### Impact:
- Application is vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing attacks
- No defense-in-depth security layers
- Fails modern security audits (SecurityHeaders.com would give an F grade)

#### Recommendation:
Implement all security headers in the Express server or deployment configuration (Priority: High)

---

### B. Cookie Security Issues

**Status:** Not explicitly identified in this scan  
**Reason:** Passive scan did not capture authenticated sessions

**To Test:**
- Login to application
- Check if cookies have `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` flags
- Verify JWT token storage mechanism

**Expected Issues:**
- JWT stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)
- Missing `SameSite=Strict` on session cookies
- Missing `Secure` flag if deployed over HTTPS

---

### C. Information Disclosure

#### Finding: Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By"

**Risk Level:** Low  
**Affected URLs:** All 5 URLs scanned  
**Evidence:** `X-Powered-By: Express`

**Impact:**
- Reveals server technology (Express/Node.js)
- Helps attackers identify framework-specific exploits
- Information gathering phase of attack is easier

**Remediation:**
```javascript
app.disable('x-powered-by');
```

---

### D. CORS Misconfiguration

**Status:** Not tested in passive scan  
**Requires Active Testing:** Yes

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- Overly permissive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- Missing `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` validation
- Reflection of arbitrary Origin headers

**To Test in Active Scan:**
- Send requests with various Origin headers
- Check if credentials are allowed with wildcard origins
- Test CORS preflight handling

---

## 5. Low Risk Findings (Should Fix)

### Finding #5: Insufficient Site Isolation Against Spectre Vulnerability

**Risk Level:** Low (Medium Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-693  
**WASC:** WASC-14  
**Instances:** 5

#### Description
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header is an opt-in header designed to counter side-channel attacks like Spectre. Resources should be specifically set as shareable amongst different origins.

#### Affected URLs
1. `http://localhost:4100` (missing Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy)
2. `http://localhost:4100/favicon.ico` (missing Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy)
3. `http://localhost:4100/static/js/bundle.js` (missing Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy)
4. `http://localhost:4100` (missing Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy)
5. `http://localhost:4100` (missing Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy)

#### Remediation
```
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

---

### Finding #6: Permissions Policy Header Not Set

**Risk Level:** Low (Medium Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-693  
**WASC:** WASC-15  
**Instances:** 4

#### Description
Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps restrict unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources (camera, microphone, location, etc.).

#### Affected URLs
1. `http://localhost:4100`
2. `http://localhost:4100/robots.txt`
3. `http://localhost:4100/sitemap.xml`
4. `http://localhost:4100/static/js/bundle.js`

#### Remediation
```
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()
```

---

### Finding #7: Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By"

**Risk Level:** Low (Medium Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-497  
**WASC:** WASC-13  
**Instances:** 5

#### Description
The web/application server is leaking information via the "X-Powered-By" HTTP response header. This helps attackers identify the technology stack.

#### Evidence
All responses contain: `X-Powered-By: Express`

#### Remediation
```javascript
// In Express server configuration
app.disable('x-powered-by');
```

---

### Finding #8: X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

**Risk Level:** Low (Medium Confidence)  
**CWE:** CWE-693  
**WASC:** WASC-15  
**Instances:** 3

#### Description
The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older browsers to MIME-sniff the response body, potentially interpreting content differently than declared.

#### Affected URLs
1. `http://localhost:4100`
2. `http://localhost:4100/favicon.ico`
3. `http://localhost:4100/static/js/bundle.js`

#### Remediation
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

---

## 6. Informational Findings

### Finding #9: Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments

**Risk Level:** Informational  
**CWE:** CWE-615  
**Instances:** 2

#### Evidence
- **URL 1:** `http://localhost:4100/static/js/bundle.js`
  - **Pattern:** `FROM` keyword
  - **Comment:** "//inherit from previous dispose call"

- **URL 2:** `http://localhost:4100`
  - **Pattern:** `FROM` keyword  
  - **Comment:** HTML comment about PUBLIC_URL

#### Assessment
These are benign development comments and do not pose a security risk. However, best practice is to strip comments from production builds.

---

### Finding #10: Modern Web Application

**Risk Level:** Informational  
**Instances:** 1

#### Description
The application appears to be a modern web application. The Ajax Spider may be more effective than the standard spider for exploring the application.

**Recommendation:** Use ZAP's Ajax Spider for more thorough active scanning.

---

### Finding #11: Storable and Cacheable Content

**Risk Level:** Informational  
**CWE:** CWE-524  
**Instances:** 4

#### Description
Response contents are storable and cacheable by proxy servers. If the response contains sensitive data, this could lead to information leakage.

#### Affected URLs
1. `http://localhost:4100`
2. `http://localhost:4100/robots.txt`
3. `http://localhost:4100/sitemap.xml`
4. `http://localhost:4100/static/js/bundle.js`

#### Assessment
These are public resources (HTML, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, JavaScript bundles) and caching is appropriate. No action needed for these specific resources.

**However:** For API responses containing user data, ensure proper cache headers:
```
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
```

---

### Finding #12: Storable but Non-Cacheable Content

**Risk Level:** Informational  
**CWE:** CWE-524  
**Instances:** 1

#### Description
Response contents are storable by caching components but will not be retrieved directly from the cache without validation.

#### Affected URLs
- `http://localhost:4100/favicon.ico` (has `max-age=0`)

#### Assessment
This is correct behavior for a favicon. No action needed.

---

## 7. Scan Coverage Analysis

### URLs Tested
1. `http://localhost:4100` - Main application (React SPA)
2. `http://localhost:4100/favicon.ico` - Favicon
3. `http://localhost:4100/robots.txt` - Robots file
4. `http://localhost:4100/sitemap.xml` - Sitemap
5. `http://localhost:4100/static/js/bundle.js` - JavaScript bundle

### Limitations of Passive Scan

**What Passive Scan DOES:**
- ✅ Analyzes HTTP responses for security issues
- ✅ Checks for missing security headers
- ✅ Identifies information disclosure
- ✅ Detects insecure configurations
- ✅ No risk of breaking the application

**What Passive Scan DOES NOT DO:**
- ❌ Test for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, Command Injection)
- ❌ Test authentication/authorization mechanisms
- ❌ Identify business logic flaws
- ❌ Test API endpoints comprehensively
- ❌ Perform brute force or fuzzing attacks
- ❌ Test for CSRF vulnerabilities

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Active Scan with authentication
2. API-specific security testing
3. Manual security testing for business logic
4. Authentication/Authorization testing
